6.6.5 License Notices for Other Files

Small supporting files, short manuals (under 300 lines long) and rough
documentation (README files, INSTALL files, etc.) can
use a simple all-permissive license like this one:


Copying and distribution of this file, with or without modification,
are permitted in any medium without royalty provided the copyright
notice and this notice are preserved.  This file is offered as-is,
without any warranty.


Older versions of this license did not have the second sentence with
the express warranty disclaimer.  There is no urgent need to update
existing files, but new files should use the new text.

If your package distributes Autoconf macros that are intended to be
used (hence distributed) by third-party packages under possibly
incompatible licenses, you may also use the above all-permissive
license for these macros.

These kinds of files can also be put in the public domain.  If
publishing in the US, it is enough to insert a notice saying so.
Otherwise, use Creative Commons’s CC0—See
.
