You may also post Error Corrections and Shared Modifications on a web-server of Your choice; provided, that You inform the Original Contributor and that You must take reasonable precautions to ensure that only Licensees have access to such Error Corrections and Shared Modifications. Such precautions shall include, without limitation and at least, a click-on, download certification of Licensee status required of those attempting to download from the server. An example of an acceptable certification is attached as Attachment A-2.

c) Notices. All Error Corrections and Shared Modifications You create or contribute to must include a file documenting the additions and changes You made and the date of such additions and changes. If it is not possible to put the notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must include the notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file), where a recipient would be most likely to look for such a notice.

d) Redistribution.
(i) Community Code. Community Code may be distributed in Source Code or Executable form to anybody that accepts the JCSL License conditions and becomes a licensee. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Community Code that alter the rights, requirements, or responsibilities of such Licensee. 
(ii) Community Code Compatibility. All Community Code must be Compliant Community Code prior to any Redistribution, whether originating from You or acquired from a third party. So if You plan to make any further Shared Modifications to any Community Code previously determined to be Compliant Community Code, you must ensure that it continues to be Compliant Community Code.
(iii) Derivative Work. If You make any non shared Modifications to any Community Code without contributing them as Shared Modifications, You must clearly indicate that your distribution is a modified version of the official Community Code and must clearly remind to your Licensees that they also have to accept the JCSL License conditions on your Derivative Work.
(iv) Modified Executable. You may distribute Executable version(s) of a Derivative Work to Licensees and other third parties only for the purpose of evaluation and comment in connection with Research and Development Use by You. You must ensure that the Executable distribution based on a Derivative Work carries a different mark than the JAHIA Trademarks. You may distribute a Derivative Work under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided (a) that You are in compliance with the terms of this License, and (b) You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by Original Contributor or any other Contributor. Any other type of use must be subject to the execution of a complementary license agreement by You and Original Contributor.
(v) Modified Class, Interface and Package Naming. In connection with Research and Development Use by You only, You may use Original Contributor's class, interface and package names only to accurately reference or invoke the Source Code files You modify. Original Contributor grants to You a limited license to the extent necessary for such purposes.
(vi) Copyrights and other Attribution Notices. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from Community Code, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your Modifications.

(vii) You expressly agree that any distribution, in whole or in part, of Modifications developed by You shall only be done pursuant to the terms and conditions of this License.

e) Extensions.
(i) Community Code. You may not include any Source Code of Community Code in any Extensions without the prior consent of the Original Contributor; 
 (ii) Open. You agree to refrain from enforcing any Intellectual Property Rights You may have covering any interface(s) of Your Extension, which would prevent the implementation of such interface(s) by Original Contributor or any Licensee. This obligation does not prevent You from enforcing any Intellectual Property Right You have that would otherwise be infringed by an implementation of Your Extension. 
(iii) Class, Interface and Package Naming. You may not add any packages, or any public or protected classes or interfaces with names that originate or might appear to originate from Original Contributor including, without limitation, package or class names which begin with "com.jahia", org.jahia or its equivalents in any subsequent class, interface and/ or package naming convention adopted by Original Contributor. It is specifically suggested that You name any new packages using the "Unique Package Naming Convention" as described in "The Java Language Specification" by James Gosling, Bill Joy, and Guy Steele, ISBN 0-201-63451-1, August 1996. Section 7.7 "Unique Package Names", on page 125 of this specification which states, in part:
"You form a unique package name by first having (or belonging to an organization that has) an Internet domain name, such as "sun.com". You then reverse the name, component by component, to obtain, in this example, "com.sun", and use this as a prefix for Your package names, using a convention developed within Your organization to further administer package names."

            The provisions of Section 7.1 of the Research and Development Use license are superseded by the following:

a) Your Indemnity Obligation. You hereby agree to defend, at Your expense, any legal proceeding brought against Original Contributor or any Licensee to the extent it is based on a claim: (i) that the use, reproduction or distribution of any of Your Error Corrections or Shared Modifications is an infringement of a third party trade secret or a copyright in a country that is a signatory to the Bern Convention; (ii) arising in connection with any representation, warranty, support, indemnity, liability or other license terms You may offer in connection with any Derivative Work; or (iii) arising from Your Commercial Use of Derivative Work, other than a claim covered by Section 5.b) below, or a patent claim based solely on Derivative Work not provided by You. You will pay all damages, costs and fees awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, or such settlement amount negotiated by You, attributable to such claim.

b) Original Contributor's Indemnity Obligation. Original Contributor will defend, at its expense, any legal proceeding brought against You, to the extent it is based on a claim that Your authorized Use of Original Code and Upgraded Code is an infringement of a third party trade secret or a copyright in a country that is a signatory to the Berne Convention. The foregoing shall not apply to any claims of intellectual property infringement based upon the combination of code or documentation supplied by Original Contributor with code, technology or documentation from other sources. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OF THE ABOVE, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR'S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO ONE HUNDRED PERCENT (100%) OF THE AMOUNT HAVING THEN ACTUALLY BEEN PAID BY YOU TO ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTOR FOR ALL COPIES LICENSED HEREUNDER OF THE PARTICULAR ITEMS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, IF ANY.

c) Right of Intervention. Original Contributor will have the right, but not the obligation, to defend You, at Original Contributor's expense, in connection with a claim that Your Use of Original Code and Upgraded Code is an infringement of a third party patent and will, if Original Contributor chooses to defend You, pay all damages, costs and fees awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction, or such settlement amount negotiated by Original Contributor, attributable to such claim.

d) Prerequisites. Under Sections 5.a), b) and c) above, Original Contributor or any Licensee must: (i) provide notice of the claim promptly to the party providing an indemnity; (ii) give the indemnifying party sole control of the defence and settlement of the claim; (iii) provide the indemnifying party, at indemnifying party's expense, all available information, assistance and authority to defend; and (iv) not have compromised or settled such claim or proceeding without the indemnifying party's prior written consent.

e) Additional Remedies. Should any Original Code, Upgraded Code, Specifications, or Shared Modifications become, or in the indemnifying party's opinion be likely to become, the subject of a claim of infringement for which indemnity is provided above, the indemnifying party may, at its sole option, attempt to procure on reasonable terms the rights necessary for the indemnified party to exercise its license rights under this License with respect to the infringing items, or to modify the infringing items so that they are no longer infringing without substantially impairing their function or performance. If the indemnifying party is unable to do the foregoing after reasonable efforts and subject to the limitation of liability, then the indemnifying party may send a notice of such inability to the indemnified party together with a refund of any license fees received by the indemnifying party from the indemnified party for the infringing items applicable to the indemnified party's future use or distribution of such infringing items, in which case the indemnifying party will again not be liable for any damages resulting from infringing activity with respect to the infringing items occurring after such notice and refund.
        
        
        
            
            
            a) Support to You. Technical support is not provided to You by Original Contributor under this License. You may contract for one or more support programs from Original Contributor or from third party partners relating to the Technology which are described on the Jahia Web Server.

            This Attachment D, only applicable in addition to the Attachment C, is effective for the Technology specified in Attachment B and reduces or suppresses the requirement to pay royalties by becoming a Contributor of the Technology in exchange of a Shared Code Counterpart. 

In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Attachment C and Attachment D, the terms of Attachment C shall govern.
        
        
        
            
            
            Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 8.10 of the Research and Development Use license, in addition to the Research and Development Use license and the Internal Deployment Use license, Original Contributor grants to You reduction or complete suppression of royalties and payments described in Section 7 of the Attachment C in exchange of additional Added Value compensated in kind for the Technology, as described below.
        
        
        
            
            
            2.1. Definitions.
a) "Added Value" means Shared Modification Code, Error Corrections and/or Specifications or documentation linked with the software which:
 (i) represents a significant functional and value added enhancement to the Technology;
(ii) operates in conjunction with the Technology; and
(iii) is not marketed as a technology which replaces or substitutes for the Technology.
b) "Shared Code Counterpart" means those Modification(s), Extension(s), Error Correction(s) and/or documentation files which are identified by You as "shareable" (or words of similar meaning), that you suggest as a counterpart to a royalty and that brings Added Value to the Technology.

2.2. Development Restrictions. Shared Code Counterpart:
a) must include Added Value to other Licensee;
b) must fully comply with the Specifications for the Technology specified in Attachment B;
c) must include the Shared Code Counterpart, complete and unmodified pursuant to Section 2.2 of the Research and Development Use license;
        
        
        
            
            
            The decision to reduce or suppress the royalties, the decided amount of reduction based on the due royalty described in the Section 7 of the Internal Deployment Use license and the criteria applied are let to the sole discretion of the Original Contributor. Original Contributor may refuse without explanation your proposal of Shared Code Counterpart.
        
        
        
            
            
            a) Original Contributor may ask You for a specific delay to contribute your Shared Code Counterpart. Default delay is fixed to 6 month. If You do not contribute your Shared Code Counterpart during the fixed delay, Section 7 of the Attachment C will take precedence over this Attachment D from the date the contract was signed.
b) The right to accept and validate Your Shared Code Counterpart is only applicable by the Original Contributor. Original Contributor may ask for modifications of your counterpart before definitely accepting it as a Shared Code Counterpart.
