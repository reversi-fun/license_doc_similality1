The lha license must be considered nonfree because it is so vague that
you cannot be sure what permissions you have.

Original Authors License Statement (from man/lha.man, translated by
Osamu Aoki <debian@aokiconsulting.com>):

   Permission is given for redistribution, copy, and modification provided
   following conditions are met.
   
   1. Do not remove copyright clause.
   2. Distribution shall conform:
    a. The content of redistribution (i.e., source code, documentation,
       and reference guide for programmers) shall include original contents.
       If contents are modified, the document clearly indicating
       the fact of modification must be included.
    b. If LHa is redistributed with added values, you must put your best
       effort to include them (Translator comment: If read literally,
       original Japanese was unclear what "them" means here.  But
       undoubtedly this "them" means source code for the added value
       portion and this is a typical Japanese sloppy writing style to
       abbreviate as such)  Also the document clearly indicating that
       added value was added must be included. 
    c. Binary only distribution is not allowed (including added value
       ones.)
   3. You need to put effort to distribute the latest version (This is not
      your duty).
   
      NB: Distribution on Internet is free.  Please notify me by e-mail or
      other means prior to the distribution if distribution is done through
      non-Internet media (Magazine, CDROM etc.)  If not, make sure to Email
      me later.
   
   4. Any damage caused by the existence and use of this program will not
      be compensated.
   
   5. Author will not be responsible to correct errors even if program is
      defective.
   
   6. This program, either as a part of this or as a whole of this, may be
      included into other programs.  In this case, that program is not LHa
      and can not call itself LHa.
   
   7. For commercial use, in addition to above conditions, following
      condition needs to be met.
   
      a.  The program whose content is mainly this program can not be used
          commercially.
      b.  If the recipient of commercial use deems inappropriate as a
          program user, you must not distribute.
      c.  If used as a method for the installation, you must not force
          others to use this program.  In this case, commercial user will
          perform its work while taking full responsibility of its outcome.
      d.  If added value is done under the commercial use by using this
          program, commercial user shall provide its support.


(Osamu Aoki also comments:
   Here "commercial" may be interpreted as "for-fee".  "Added value" seems
   to mean "feature enhancement".  )

Translated License Statement by Tsugio Okamoto (translated by

   It's free to distribute on the network, but if you distribute for
   the people who cannot access the network (by magazine or CD-ROM),
   please send E-Mail (Inter-Net address) to the author before the
   distribution. That's well where this software is appeard.
   If you cannot do, you must send me the E-Mail later.
